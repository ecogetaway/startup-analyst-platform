# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide - Google Tech Stack

## ‚è∞ **Time Required: 45 minutes**

## üìö **Beginner-Friendly Explanations**

### **What is Google Cloud?**
Think of Google Cloud as a huge computer in the sky that you can rent to run your applications. Instead of buying expensive servers, you use Google's powerful computers over the internet.

### **What are APIs?**
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are like "doors" that let your Python code talk to Google's services. Each API is a specific door for a specific service (like AI, storage, etc.).

     - **Why do we need it?** To securely store API keys and app settings
     - **Think of it as:** A secure settings panel for your application

### **Step 2: Create Service Account (10 minutes)**

#### **What is a Service Account?**
A service account is like a special user account that your Python application uses to access Google's services. It's like giving your app its own ID card to enter Google's buildings.

#### **Why do we need this?**
Your Python code needs permission to use Google's services. The service account is like a key that unlocks access to Vertex AI, Firebase, and other services.

1. Go to **IAM & Admin** ‚Üí **Service Accounts**
   - **What is IAM?** Identity and Access Management - it controls who can access what
   - **Why?** It's like a security system for your cloud resources

2. Click **"Create Service Account"**
   - **What are we doing?** Creating a special account for our Python application
   - **Why?** So our app can securely access Google's services

3. Name: `startup-analyst-sa`
   - **What is this?** A unique name for our service account
   - **Why this name?** "sa" stands for "service account" - it's a common naming convention

4. Add these roles (think of roles as permissions):
   - `Vertex AI User`
     - **What does this do?** Allows our app to use Google's AI services
     - **Why?** So we can analyze startups with advanced AI
   
   - `Firebase Admin`
     - **What does this do?** Allows our app to read/write data in Firebase
     - **Why?** So we can store analysis results and show live updates
   
   - `Storage Admin`
     - **What does this do?** Allows our app to upload/download files
     - **Why?** So users can upload pitch decks and documents
   
   - `Cloud Run Admin`
     - **What does this do?** Allows our app to deploy and manage itself
     - **Why?** So we can put our app online for judges to use
   
   - `Runtime Configuration Admin`
     - **What does this do?** Allows our app to manage its settings
     - **Why?** So we can securely store API keys and configurations

5. **Download JSON key** ‚Üí Save as `service-account-key.json`
   - **What is this file?** A secret key that proves our app is allowed to use Google's services
   - **Why do we need it?** It's like a password that our Python code will use
   - **Important:** Keep this file secure - don't share it publicly!

### **Step 3: Firebase Setup (10 minutes)**

#### **What is Firebase?**
Firebase is Google's platform for building mobile and web applications. It provides real-time databases, authentication, and other services that make apps work smoothly.

#### **Why do we need Firebase?**
Firebase will help us:
- Store analysis results so they don't get lost
- Show live progress updates during analysis
- Allow multiple users to collaborate
- Keep track of user preferences

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - **What is this?** Firebase's control panel (separate from Google Cloud Console)
   - **Why separate?** Firebase has its own interface for app-specific features

2. **Create project**: `startup-analyst-platform`
   - **What are we doing?** Creating a Firebase project that matches our Google Cloud project
   - **Why the same name?** So they can work together seamlessly

3. **Enable Firestore Database**:
   - **What is Firestore?** A NoSQL database that stores data in real-time
   - **What is NoSQL?** A type of database that's flexible and fast (unlike traditional SQL databases)
   - **Why do we need it?** To store startup analysis results and user data
   
   - Go to **Firestore Database**
   - Click **"Create database"**
   - Choose **"Start in test mode"**
     - **What is test mode?** A mode that allows anyone to read/write data (good for development)
     - **Why test mode?** It's easier to set up and test our application
     - **Security note:** For production, we'd use more restrictive rules
   - Select **"us-central1"** region
     - **What is a region?** The physical location where your data is stored
     - **Why us-central1?** It's close to most users and has good performance

4. **Enable Authentication**:
   - **What is Authentication?** A system that verifies who users are
   - **Why do we need it?** So users can log in and save their analysis history
   
   - Go to **Authentication**
   - Click **"Get started"**
   - Enable **"Email/Password"** sign-in
     - **What does this do?** Allows users to sign up and log in with email/password
     - **Why email/password?** It's the most common and user-friendly login method

### **Step 4: Test Everything (10 minutes)**

#### **Why do we test?**
Testing ensures that all the Google services are properly connected and working. It's like checking that all the lights in your house work before having guests over.

#### **What will the test do?**
The test will:
- Check if your API keys are working
- Verify that Google services can communicate with your code
- Test each service individually
- Show you exactly what's working and what needs fixing

```bash
# Test comprehensive Google tech stack
python3 test_comprehensive_google_stack.py
```
- **What does this command do?** Runs a Python script that tests all Google services
- **What will you see?** A detailed report showing which services are working
- **If it fails:** The error messages will tell you exactly what to fix

```bash
# If successful, run enhanced backend
python3 backend/enhanced_main.py
```
- **What does this command do?** Starts your startup analysis platform
- **What will you see?** Your application running on your computer
- **How to access it?** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

   - **What this means:** Google doesn't know you want to use their services
   - **How to fix:** Go back to Step 1 and enable the APIs
   - **Why it happens:** APIs are disabled by default for security

2. **Service account missing** ‚Üí Create and download key
   - **What this means:** Your Python code doesn't have permission to access Google services
   - **How to fix:** Go back to Step 2 and create the service account
   - **Why it happens:** Google requires authentication for security

3. **Firebase not set up** ‚Üí Create project and enable Firestore
   - **What this means:** Your app can't store data or show live updates
   - **How to fix:** Go back to Step 3 and set up Firebase
   - **Why it happens:** Firebase is a separate service that needs its own setup

4. **Permissions denied** ‚Üí Check service account roles
   - **What this means:** Your service account doesn't have the right permissions
   - **How to fix:** Go back to Step 2 and add the missing roles
   - **Why it happens:** Google uses "least privilege" - only give access to what's needed

### **Quick Fixes**
```bash
# Check Google services status
python3 test_comprehensive_google_stack.py
```
- **What this does:** Tests all services and tells you exactly what's wrong

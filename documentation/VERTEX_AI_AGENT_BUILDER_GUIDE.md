2. **Create Orchestration Script**:
   ```python
   # Create file: src/agents/vertex_ai_orchestrator.py
   from google.adk import BaseAgent, WorkflowAgent, SequentialAgent
   import vertexai
   from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
   
   class VertexAIAgent(BaseAgent):
       """Base class for Vertex AI agents"""
       
       def __init__(self, agent_name, model_name="gemini-1.5-pro"):
           self.agent_name = agent_name
           self.model = GenerativeModel(model_name)
           self.agent_config = self._create_agent_config()
       
       def _create_agent_config(self):
           return {
               "name": self.agent_name,
               "description": f"Specialized agent for {self.agent_name}",
               "model": "gemini-1.5-pro",
               "tools": self._get_agent_tools(),
               "instructions": self._get_agent_instructions()
           }
   
   class StartupAnalysisWorkflow(WorkflowAgent):
       """Orchestrates all startup analysis agents"""
       
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           self.agents = {
               "data_collection": DataCollectionAgent(),
               "business_analysis": BusinessAnalysisAgent(),
               "risk_assessment": RiskAssessmentAgent(),
               "investment_insights": InvestmentInsightsAgent(),
               "report_generation": ReportGenerationAgent()
           }
       
       def execute_workflow(self, startup_data):
           """Execute complete startup analysis workflow"""
           
           # Step 1: Data Collection (can run independently)
           data_results = self.agents["data_collection"].analyze(startup_data)
           
           # Step 2: Parallel Analysis (can run simultaneously)
           business_results = self.agents["business_analysis"].analyze(data_results)
           risk_results = self.agents["risk_assessment"].analyze(data_results)
           
           # Step 3: Investment Insights (needs previous results)
           investment_results = self.agents["investment_insights"].analyze({
               "data": data_results,
               "business": business_results,
               "risks": risk_results
           })
           
           # Step 4: Report Generation (needs all results)
           report_results = self.agents["report_generation"].analyze({
               "data": data_results,
               "business": business_results,
               "risks": risk_results,
               "investment": investment_results
           })
           
           return {
               "data_collection": data_results,
               "business_analysis": business_results,
               "risk_assessment": risk_results,
               "investment_insights": investment_results,
               "report_generation": report_results
           }
   ```

3. **Configure Agent Connections**:
   - **What is this?** Setting up how agents communicate with each other
   - **Why?** Agents need to share data and results
   
   ```python
   # Configure agent connections
   workflow = StartupAnalysisWorkflow()
   
   # Set up data flow between agents
   workflow.add_connection("data_collection", "business_analysis")
   workflow.add_connection("data_collection", "risk_assessment")
   workflow.add_connection("business_analysis", "investment_insights")
   workflow.add_connection("risk_assessment", "investment_insights")
   workflow.add_connection("investment_insights", "report_generation")
   ```

4. **Add Error Handling**:
   - **What is this?** Making sure the system continues working even if one agent fails
   - **Why?** Robust systems need to handle errors gracefully
   
   ```python
   def execute_workflow_with_error_handling(self, startup_data):
       """Execute workflow with robust error handling"""
       
       try:
           # Execute workflow
           results = self.execute_workflow(startup_data)
           return results
           
       except Exception as e:
           # Log error and continue with available results
           print(f"Error in workflow: {str(e)}")
           
           # Return partial results if possible
           return self._get_partial_results(startup_data)
   ```

5. **Test Orchestration**:
   - **What is this?** Making sure all agents work together correctly
   - **Why?** We need to verify the complete system works
   
   ```python
   # Test the complete workflow
   workflow = StartupAnalysisWorkflow()
   test_data = {
       "company_name": "Test Startup",
       "business_description": "AI-powered test automation"
   }
   
   results = workflow.execute_workflow(test_data)
   print("Workflow completed successfully!")
   ```

   ```python
   # Test the complete system
   orchestrator = FirebaseWorkflowOrchestrator()
   
   test_data = {
       "company_name": "Test Startup",
       "business_description": "AI-powered test automation"
   }
   
   results = orchestrator.execute_workflow_with_updates(test_data, "test_user")
   print("Complete workflow with real-time updates completed!")
   ```
